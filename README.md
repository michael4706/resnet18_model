### resnet18_model
 
This project is written by Michael Hung and Yu-Chieh Chen.

This project focus on exploring the resnet18 model. We'd trained two models: resnet18 without pretrained parameters and resnet18 with pretrained parameters. We also added more layers on top of the resnet18 layers to suit our need to work on Cifar Dataset.

* The notebook is the detailed version of the entire steps of building the model.
* The train.py is the simplified version to train the model(without plotting and evaluation of the model).
* Resnet18.pt is the model without transfer learning.
* Resnet18_tl.pt is the model with transfer learning.
